# Commented rws7class and replaced it with RWS used at UiS
# Replaced all the functions used from rws7class with their counter parts from rwsuis
# Also used some other functions from RWS that do the job of some the code in this file
#
# Minor updates for UiS ELE610 course by Karl Skretting October 2023 ...
